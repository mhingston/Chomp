# Chomp

Create optimised versions of JS/CSS files based on [Chrome coverage](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/devtools-release-notes#coverage) reports.

## Usage

```
chomp -i coverage.json
```

N.B. At the time of writing, to export coverage reports from Chrome you need to be using the Dev or Canary release channel.
